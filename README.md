# Whatsappify Video

A simple utility to convert video files to a whatsapp-compatible format. Have you downloaded a video from the internet and want to share it on whatsapp, but whatsapp just won't accept the video? Try this utility.

## Usage
 - Clone this repository
 - edit the `src/cmd.sh` file with the input and output file paths and names
 - run the `src/cmd.sh` file


You will need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) too.

## License and Stuff

This just runs an ffmpeg command that I took from [a stack overflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39887869/ffmpeg-whatsapp-video-format-not-supported). I put it here to make it easy to find and remember. Use, share, and distribute at your own risk, refer to [ffmpeg license](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html).
